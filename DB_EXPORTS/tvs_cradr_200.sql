Yes, if you close it quickly. I understood that the interest will be less. I understood that the interest will be less. Sir, it may be 10% interest. Let me tell you a simple calculation. For 2500, the amount will be closed for 36 months. the amount will be closed for 36 months. Okay. It will be closed for 36 months. You know that the amount will increase, right? If you close it for 6 months, it will be closed for 2500. If you close it for 6 months, it will be closed for 2500. If you want to close the balance, you need to close it for 7 months. That is, you need to close it for 30 months. The amount will increase. If you close it in one go, they won''t take that much amount as a closing figure. Okay. If they increase the balance amount and reduce the interest rate in the amount, they will receive an accurate amount. It won''t be a wrong amount. For a normal 6-month interest, it will be more than that, right? The interest of a person with a 6-month interest will be increased by 2500. will be increased by 2500. If I take the amount, it will be a little more than the amount I took 6 months ago, right? When I close it after 6 months, it will be less than that. Is it? Yes, the amount will be less. Now, you have closed the loan for 6 months. Okay. You have closed the loan for 6 months. If you increase the balance, you will get a figure that you have to pay 2500 for 30 months. You will get an accurate amount. If it is 35, then 2500, you don''t have to pay 75,000. If you have closed the loan correctly, you have to pay 75,000 for 36 months. Okay? If you close the loan after 6 months, it will be less than 75,000. It will come down, right? It won''t go up, right? That''s my doubt. Only then will the interest be less. That''s my doubt. We won''t benefit from closing the loan after 6 months, right? Okay. I will come there. I will come there. I need to get some money. How much should I close first? How much should I close? If you have a civil score, you can close the loan at the lowest amount. If you have a civil score, you can close the loan at 4000 or 5000. If you want to close the loan, you don''t have to pay any interest, right? No, I don''t have to pay any interest. You can close the loan after 2 years. That will be the most profitable.
