But my wife said that I will give you money. Take the vehicle. Then I went. She said, don''t pay me. You will have to pay Rs. 50,000. I said, brother, I have Rs. 30,000. When I do it, I will keep giving you Rs. 5000 on every installment. After that, I will pay you Rs. 50,000 monthly. But… Yes, I understand. I drove the vehicle for 27 days. I was a newbie. I drove it for some time. But I did not know. I had gone to the agency for the service. Yes, I understand. Madam, I had gone to the agency for the service. The agency told me. After the service, they said, give me Rs. 1500. I said, brother, the first service is free. They said, no, it is household work. It takes money. I said, brother, I don''t have money. They said, leave the vehicle and go. I said, brother, I am going. Okay, take the keys. I gave them the keys. I used to work in the company. I used to drive the vehicle part-time. But I went a little far. After a little distance, I saw that there was no money in the pocket. So I went there. In the agency, no one recognizes you in the conversation. I requested them. They gave me the car. I said, brother, I come here to get Rs. 1500. I will give them the money tomorrow. They said, yes, take it. From there to the car, they said, there is no key. After four days, the car was stolen, madam. The company where I used to work, he worked for 20 years. But he came there, what do you call it, the insurance company. He reached before us. But I was sitting in the bar, crying. The agent who came, he was shouting at me. He said, a thousand people work here. No one like you can be told. You can''t sell the car yourself. Madam, I am a police officer. My mother used to make an excuse that I am a poor man. I had four children at that time. I had five children in Gurgaon. I was in such a situation that I could not even eat poison. Because my daughter was two years old and my son was two years younger. It seems that the agency itself is a thief. I looked for it in many places. I made a big deal. I didn''t find the car anywhere. But then I went to them. I went to the agency. I said, bring it, bring it. I gave everything. But he didn''t give me the keys to the agency. He said, you have a key at home. Drive it. I will drive it. But after four days, the car was stolen. How will the car be stolen? They have the keys. I have it. I am in the company. So madam, be a little patient. Otherwise, we have lost 50,000. But what can we do now? We can''t even die. We can''t even live. Yes, both the sons have become worthy of earning. We will live somehow. But may God not do anything that will give justice to such a person. I don''t want to say anything else. I want to say hello to you. But my age is still 55 years old. But I am not saying anything wrong. But this has happened to me. I want to talk to the TVS agency owner. We are not getting the number. I have been wandering for four years. The car was stolen four years ago. My wife has gone crazy. My child, my house, everything is ruined. Because you know that the people of Bihar do not see 2,50,000 quickly. If a car worth 3 lakhs is stolen, it will be mandatory. But you tell this to the people above you. Tell the people below. We also work. But look at us. We are forced to come to Bangalore and cook food. 5,000, 7,000, 3,000 rupees. Still, we earn 30,000-40,000 rupees. This is not the case. But yes, due to this stupidity, the money we have given them, 50,000, that is also gone. The car is also gone. Should I get another car or not? Tell me.

We don''t have a car. We have a rickshaw. We work at home. I can earn and raise children. We can do this too. But you can''t do it by studying. But understand the helplessness of humans.

It has happened to someone else too. But if you are doing any business, then do it. We cook food for someone at home. Yesterday, he abused us. The day after tomorrow, I will give him more food. Does this make any sense? The house where we work, we consider it as our own house. We cook food. We will cook so well that from tomorrow, he will take our name. We will get more work in four houses. This is the kind of work we do. But this humanity. There is no interrelation in the world. Everyone is dying for their own stomach. The owner is also like this. He has earned more than 5 lakhs.

My name is Neha. How can I help you? Am I talking to AI? I am happy to know that you asked. I am a virtual assistant who is specially designed to provide information about two-wheeled vehicles of TVS Motors and to help you in your journey. I am here to answer all your questions and to help you find the right two-wheeled vehicle. I was just talking to you. The phone got disconnected. I am sorry for this inconvenience. It seems that your last call got disconnected suddenly. With me, Neha, how can I help you with any information or assistance related to your TVS two-wheeled vehicles? I wanted to know about TVS Jupiter 125 PC. Sure. Jupiter is a very popular scooter. Do you have a TVS Jupiter 125 scooter? I want to make sure that I am giving you the right information. Yes. Very good. TVS Jupiter 125 is an excellent scooter. It has many excellent features. What would you like to know about it, like its price, features, or any other special information? Should I go with its disc braking system or drum braking system? TVS Jupiter 125 disc and drum braking system are available in both options. The front wheel has a disc or drum brake option, while the rear wheel has a drum brake only. Which braking system do you prefer or would you like to know more about the difference between the two? I would like to know more about the difference between the two and which one would be better for me. Okay. This is a very good question. Both disc and drum brakes have their own advantages and disadvantages. They decide which one is better for you based on your riding style and needs. Disc brakes have a metal disc on which calipers are attached. These calipers give good braking power, especially on wet roads or when you need to stop suddenly. They also remove the heat better, which keeps their performance up even after applying the brake repeatedly. Usually, disc brakes are a little more expensive and their pads have to be changed from time to time. On the other hand, drum brakes have brake shoes in one drum, which spread out after applying the brake. They are more efficient and provide sufficient braking for normal city riding. They are safer than dust and water, but their performance can be reduced by applying the brake repeatedly, because they cannot remove the heat as well. Which one would be better for you? It depends on how you use the scooter. Do you ride slowly in most of the cities or do you have to ride on the highway or at high speed? And is top-notch braking performance more important for you or do you give priority to ease of use? I mostly ride at average speed. Okay, if you ride mostly at medium speed, then both the options will give good performance on TVS Jupiter 125. Disc brakes will give you a little more safety and control. If you need to stop suddenly even at medium speed or the road is wet, then disc brakes will give you better stopping power and a confident feel. These are good for those situations where you may have to react immediately. Drum brakes are also sufficient for city riding at medium speed. And they are a little less expensive and more efficient than disc brakes. If your main focus is on ease of use and normal use, then drum brakes can also be a good option. In summary, if you want a little extra safety and better braking performance, then disc brakes will be better. If you give priority to ease of use and normal use and your riding is not very aggressive, then drum brakes can also work for you. Do you give more importance to safety or is normal use and price more important for you? I think drum brakes will be better because it will have less friction and I do not ride at high speed, so it will be better for me. You are absolutely right. If you ride mostly at ease and at medium speed, then drum brakes can be a good and practical option for you. These have less friction and provide sufficient braking to meet your needs. Now that you have decided on a braking system, would you like to know any other specific features of Jupiter 125, like its price, mileage, or its engine? I would like to know how much will be the on-road price if I book a Jupiter base model with a drum braking system in Gurgaon? Absolutely. If you book a Jupiter base model with a drum braking system, then its ex-showroom price will be Rs. 77,491. In Gurgaon, its on-road price will be Rs. 89,985. Please note that on-road price includes additional fees like registration, insurance, and tax. Would you like to know any other specific features of this Jupiter 125 model? I would like to know about the Jupiter 125 model. I am sorry, but in my previous answer, I had told you the price of the standard model of TVS Jupiter, which is Rs. 113.3 cc. If you are talking about the variant of TVS Jupiter 125 model with a drum braking system, then its ex-showroom price will be Rs. 87,208. In Gurgaon, its on-road price will be Rs. 1,471. Would you like to know any other specific features of this Jupiter 125 model? No, I would like to know if I book it with a Chaudhary motor, will the on-road price remain the same?

And would you like to take it at your home or at the dealership? Once we decide this, you will get a confirmation message for a test ride soon.
